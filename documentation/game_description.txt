Xd_tower is a competitive game featuring two seemingly independent players endeavoring to jump their way through platforms scrolling downwards without falling. It is only after one of the players manages to gain a powerup, when they start to realize their gameplays depend on each other. Not only that. They realize they are actually oponents in this crazy world. Powerups gathered by a player are able to induce overwhelmingly funny effects for a second player, which make it harder to fight with gravity and climb through platforms. Jumping can prove difficult on its own, but combined with frequent laughter it can drive people crazy. Better equip with finger dexterity and a strong stomach endurance to cope with hilarious situations unraveling during the gameplay!
